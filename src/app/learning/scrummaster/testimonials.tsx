              I recently finished a training course that was a great introduction to Scrum mastery, with practical examples used throughout the training that made everything feel relevant and easy to understand. The team was great about sending reminders for lesson times, which helped keep me on track. Additionally, the engaging quizzes made the learning process interactive. Iâ€™ve just started my internship, and the onboarding has been both warm and welcoming.

              My journey with Quales through learning Scrum, taking the exam, and completing an internship has been incredibly rewarding. From the classes to the Exam support to my internship with Quales now, it has been all I hoped for and more. The combination of theoretical learning and practical experience has given me a solid foundation in Scrum, and I am excited to continue applying these skills in my career.
