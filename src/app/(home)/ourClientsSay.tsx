              Prior to Quales supporting Seamfix, we had a very low rate of automation in the course of building our apps, this slowed regression efforts in preparation for our releases and we faced the danger of not responding to our customer needs in a timely manner. Since we got Quales onboard, in just about three months, automation efforts increased significantly which led to quick internal feedback and resolution of issues. This has helped us win back our partnersâ€™ trust in responding in an agile manner to their demands.

              We had a tough timeline in ensuring our back-end engineering system for our payment system was tested within two months due to some new critical changes. With Quales consulting for us, they showed tenacity, vigor, competency, professionalism and most importantly ensured quality was assured in our application within the timelines. They are our go-to people Appzone wide when it comes to Software Testing.
